# A PyTorch implementation of MobileNetV3

This is a PyTorch implementation of MobileNetV3 architecture as described in the paper [Searching for MobileNetV3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02244.pdf).

Some details may be different from the original paper, welcome to discuss and help me figure it out.

## Training & Accuracy
In progress ...


## Usage
Pretrained model are still training ...
```python
    # large
    net_large = mobilenetv3(mode='large')
    # small
    net_small = mobilenetv3(mode='small')
```
